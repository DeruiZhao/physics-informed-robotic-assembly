# Sequence Planning and Physics-Informed Robotic Simulation for assembly of deformable beam structures

This repository contains the computational framework developed for my Master's thesis, addressing sequence planning and physics-informed simulation for assembly of deformable beam structures in the CAE industry.

## Sequence Planning (Rhino / Grasshopper)

- **Environment**:
  - Rhino + Grasshopper (Python 3.9)
  - Karamba3D (for FEA)

## Robotic Assembly Simulation

- **Environment**: WSL2 (Ubuntu 24.04) + Python 3.8
- **Dependencies**: PyBullet, pybullet-planning, OpenSeesPy
- **Codebase Note**:
    > Builds upon [pybullet-planning](https://github.com/caelan/pybullet-planning) (MIT License)
